oh whoa [x3]

you know you love me, i know you care
just shout whenever, and i'll be there
you are my love, you are my heart
and we would never ever ever be apart

are we an item? girl, quit playing
we're just friends, what are you saying?
say there's another and look right in my eyes
my first love broke my heart for the first time
and i was like...

baby, baby, baby oooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo
like baby, baby, baby oooh
i thought you'd always be mine (mine)

baby, baby, baby oooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo
like baby, baby, baby oooh
i thought you'd always be mine (mine)

oh, for you i would have done whatever
and i just can't believe we ain't together
and i wanna play it cool, but i'm losin' you
i'll buy you anything, i'll buy you any ring
and i'm in pieces, baby fix me
and just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
i'm going down, down, down, down
and i just can't believe my first love won't be around

and i'm like
baby, baby, baby oooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo
like baby, baby, baby oooh
i thought you'd always be mine (mine)

baby, baby, baby oooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo
like baby, baby, baby oooh
i thought you'd always be mine (mine)

luda! when i was 13, i had my first love,
there was nobody that compared to my baby
and nobody came between us or could ever come above
she had me going crazy, oh, i was star-struck,
she woke me up daily, don't need no starbucks.
she made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when i see her in the street and
at school on the playground but i really wanna see her on the weekend.
she knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
and now my heart is breaking but i just keep on saying...

baby, baby, baby oooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo
like baby, baby, baby oooh
i thought you'd always be mine (mine)

baby, baby, baby oooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo
like baby, baby, baby oooh
i thought you'd always be mine (mine)

i'm gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
now i'm all gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
now i'm all gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
now i'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)
